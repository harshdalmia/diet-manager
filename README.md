we developed a diet system and drinking water recording system in C++ to help users track their daily meals and water intake for improved health and wellness. The system  allow users to input their meals and water consumption, view summaries of their daily intake, and receive feedback on their hydration goals.
to run this program:
: clone the repository
: compile the main cpp
: run the main.exe
our program work flow is
1> first the user input there details such as name,blood group,age,weight,sex,height,preference of diet
2> then it tells you about your fat percentage and bmi and wether you are overweight,underweight or healthy
3> it gives you a menu in which it asks you 4 options
